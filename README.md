# KNN, Naive Bayes, and ID3 Algorithms from Scratch

Welcome to this awesome repository! Here, we have implemented **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, **Naive Bayes**, and **ID3 (Decision Tree)** algorithms from scratch using Python. This project provides a hands-on understanding of how these algorithms work under the hood, making it perfect for anyone passionate about machine learning.
